Dear Kanxu, 
<br>
I have finally had the time to reflect on the events that have happened, hence I am writing this. You might have felt a lot of emotions over the past week. I can understand how overwhelming it must be to go through these emotions. I am writing this to ask for your forgiveness and nothing else. I know my actions have hurt you deeply, and hence the silence. 
<br>
I want to apologise for the hurt I have caused you. Sweetheart, I know that there's no justification for this, but I wanted to tell you that none of this was done to hurt you or out of ego; it was an act of impulse, and I genuinely regret my behaviour. And, I don't expect you to forgive me in a blink, but rather, I would like you to take your sweet time and space to process this. I've realized how much I value this connection, and I promise you, this will never happen again. 
<br>My Dear, Not having you around sucks, and I miss you already. After all, you are my sunflower, and I am your sunshine. Yet when your petals close, my rays have nowhere to go; they lose their meaning, perhaps it scatters into an empty sky, a void endlessly seeking your embrace. I am sorry, I let my light grow too harsh, and without a sunflower like you to dance in my light, this radiance becomes a lonely flame, burning in emptiness. Perhaps, I am only a fool who was handed the key to paradise, but kept on examining the metal, questioning everything until the door closed forever. Forgive me, sweetheart, for the fool I am. I have been a stranger to myself, but with you, I remember who I might become. 
<br>
I truly hope you can find it in your heart to open that door for me again whenever you're ready. 
<br>
With Love, 
<br>
