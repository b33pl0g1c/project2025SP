      Dear Kanxu, 
<br>
I have finally had the time to reflect on the events that happened between us earlier, so I am writing this. You might have felt a lot of emotions over the past week. I know how overwhelming it must be to go through these emotions, and I take full responsibility.
<br>
My Dearest Kanxu, how do I even begin? Not having you around sucks, and I miss you already. After all, you are my sunflower, and I am your sunshine. Yet when your petals close, my rays have nowhere to go; they lose their meaning, perhaps it scatters into an empty sky, a void endlessly seeking your embrace. I am sorry, I let my light grow too harsh, and without a sunflower like you to dance in my light, this radiance becomes a lonely flame, burning in emptiness. Perhaps, I am only a fool who was handed the key to paradise, but kept on examining the metal, questioning its authenticity, analysing its weight, until the door closed forever. 
      <br>
Forgive me, sweetheart, for the fool I am. I have been a stranger to myself, but with you, I remember who I might become. 
<br>
With Love,
